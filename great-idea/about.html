  <h2>About us</h2>

  <p>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the fire nation attacked. only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. One hundred years past, and we discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone. But we believe Aang can save the world!</p>
